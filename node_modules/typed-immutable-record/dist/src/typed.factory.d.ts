 * Creates a factory function you can use to make TypedRecords.

 *
 * Additionally, TypedRecords created by the factory function will have the
 * TypeScript shape defined by E.
 *
 * Finally, these TypedRecords expose the same interface as
 * Immutable.Map<string, any>, but type adjusted to that mutating methods return
 * a TypedRecord of the original type.
 *
 * The caller must provide two interfaces described below:
 *
 * <E>: The TypeScript shape of the plain JavaScript object to be made
 * immutable.
 *
 * <T>: The desired TypedRecord type that each immutable record produced by the
 * factory will have. In nearly all cases this will be an interface
 * that extends TypedRecord<T> & E.
 *
 * @param obj is a plain JS that meets the requirements described in the
 * provided <E> interface. This object is used to set the default values of the
 * Immutable.Record
 * @param name of the record
 * @returns {function(E=): T} a function Factory to produce instances of a
 * TypedRecord<T>
