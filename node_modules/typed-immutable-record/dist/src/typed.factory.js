 * Additionally, TypedRecords created by the factory function will have the
 * TypeScript shape defined by E.
 *
 * Finally, these TypedRecords expose the same interface as
 * Immutable.Map<string, any>, but type adjusted to that mutating methods return
 * a TypedRecord of the original type.
 *

 *
 * <E>: The TypeScript shape of the plain JavaScript object to be made
 * immutable.
 *
 * <T>: The desired TypedRecord type that each immutable record produced by the
 * factory will have. In nearly all cases this will be an interface

 * provided <E> interface. This object is used to set the default values of the
